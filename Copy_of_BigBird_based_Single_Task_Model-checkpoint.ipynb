Then, the integer x is inadequate\\r\\nonly if the last digit of x is strictly less than the reminder of\\r\\ndivision of k by 11. Here\\r\\nlfloor x / 10\\r\\nrfloor denotes x/10 rounded down.Thus, if x is the m-th in increasing\\r\\norder inadequate number, and m gives the remainder c when divided by 11,\\r\\nthen integers 10\\r\\ncdot x + 0, 10\\r\\ncdot x + 1\\r\\nldots, 10\\r\\ncdot x + (c - 1) are inadequate, while integers 10\\r\\ncdot x + c, 10\\r\\ncdot x + (c + 1),\\r\\nldots, 10\\r\\ncdot x + 9 are not inadequate.The first several inadequate integers are\\r\\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 21, 30, 31, 32\\r\\nldots. After that, since 4 is the fourth inadequate integer, 40, 41, 42,\\r\\n43 are inadequate, while 44, 45, 46,\\r\\nldots, 49 are not inadequate; since 10 is the 10-th inadequate number,\\r\\nintegers 100, 101, 102,\\r\\nldots, 109 are all inadequate.
