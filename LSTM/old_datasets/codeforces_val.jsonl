1 we will know that since we get a monotone triple leading to contradiction Second part can be verified easily For every array of length must have monotone triple WLOG we just need to prove the observation holds when and cases when not all elements are equal In that case one of extremal can be reached in position other than WLOG we will assume that maximum is reached at position However

there exists such that fails to reach maximum and minimum among This observation allows us to solve this task in with some precalculation though it s still not enough to get accepted Let s solve the task for a sequence of a pairwise distinct numbers and then change the conditions to a general sequence Let s fix the leftmost element of and look at what we are asked to find So there should be some position to the right of so that the range of values on positions excluding the greatest and the smallest values includes both and Let s process the array from right to left maintaining two stacks The top element in both stacks is the currently processed one Next element of the first stack is the closest to the right element greater than the top one and the next element of the second stack is the closest to the right smaller than the top one And the stacks go like that until the end of array Iterating over one of these stacks will show the increase of the range of values in one direction iterating over both at the same time will show how the range of values changes in total So I claim that the sequence we are looking for exists iff both stacks include more than element and there is an element to the right of second elements of both stacks such that it is included in neither of the stacks Naturally that condition tells that there is some position in which neither maximum nor minimum values are updated The values that are in neither of stacks can be maintained in a queue or in a BIT Basically the position when the range of values doesn t change is such a value which is both smaller than the maximum value on the segment and greater than the minimum one Thus we can choose the latest elements in both stacks up to that position and that position itself How to deal with not pairwise distinct elements Well it s enough to change the conditions in stacks to the next greater or equal and the next smaller or equal However that will push the elements equal to the current one right next to it to the both stacks Previously we kinda used the fact that no element except the current one is in both stacks I think that the easiest way to deal with it is to get the answer for the rightmost of the consecutive equal elements and then just say that the answer for the rest of them is the same Finally push all these consecutive equal elements to the both stacks As for queries I previously said that we can take the position where the value range doesn t change Basically the first valid position is coincidentally the shortest length valid segment starting from So to find the first position you just need to do a binary search over that queue or BIT of the values which are in neither of the stacks We can easily remember it for each position and then do a range minimum query

of building a tree for a subarray Let s label the node created at that moment to be We realize that will be the size of the subtree of that node However in our problem some positions can be blanks so the actual subtree size of a node is the number of positions that are not blanks in the subarray So now we are finding the sum of the number of non blanks in the range for each node in our cartesian

"The problem asks for finding the lexicographically n th permutation satisfying the input constraints The trick which confused many contestants as well as a few authors and testers is that instead of having the restrictions formulated in a way position a i position b i the restrictions were element at position a i element at position b i As in most problems where one has to output lexicographically n th answer the idea which can result in the solution which is passing the systests is to learn how to compute the number of solutions satisfying certain constraints We will speak about how to compute the number of solutions in a bit but first let s understand how having such function would lead to a solution The very first observation is if the total number of possible solutions is less than y 2000 then the answer is The times have changed Once we have ensured that the solution exists it can be found using some of search A simple approach would be the following fix the first element of the resulting permutation to be 1 and count the number of possible solutions If we do have enough to reach year y then the first element must be 1 because there exists enough permutations with the first element being 1 to cover the years up to y and any permutation where the first element is not 1 comes after any permutation where the first element is 1 in lexicographical order And if fixing the first element to be 1 is not giving enough permutations then we should decrease the desired year by the number of solutions with 1 being fixed as the first element and start looking for the solutions with 2 as the first element The intuition is that there are not enough solutions with 1 being the first element but once we acknowledge that and start looking for the other solutions with 2 as the first element we are speaking not about arrangements for years 2001 and onwards but about the years 2001 number of solutions with first element being one and onwards Therefore instead of looking for the permutation with index y 2001 with the first element being 1 we are looking for the permutation with the lower index y 2001 number of solutions with first element being one with the first element being 2 or higher This process should be continued until all the elements are identified Once the first index is fixed the known prefix would become a two numbers prefix and it will grow until all the permutation is constructed Now to complete the solution we need to be able to compute the number of permutations which satisfy two restrictions the input constraints and the added permutation has prefix P constraint This problem can be solved using DP For a given prefix P of length m n m other elements should be placed Assume first that we are going to be iterating over all possible permutations with the given prefix using the brute force but instead of trying each possible value for the element at the next empty position i we would be trying each possible position for the next not yet placed element i This approach would work but in O n m time which is obviously unfeasible We need to find some way to reduce the state space and make it run faster The key observation is the following the state of the partially solved problem can be completely described by the bitmask of the currently occupied positions This statement is nontrivial as from the first glance it seems that apart from the unused positions mask the information about the order in which the already placed elements are placed is important However it s not Recall that all the constraints have the form of element at position ai is less than the element at position bi Provided the elements are placed in increasing order in order to satisfy each constraint it s enough to confirm that if the element to be placed is being put into position i there is no such constraint in the input that the element at position i should be less than the element at position j while the element at position j has already been placed This approach results in the DP with 2n m states Note that the next element to be placed can always be determined by the number of bits set in the mask and the prefix elements The implementation of the above algorithm requires nontrivial coding as the elements belonging to the prefix have to be treated differently compared to the elements which were placed by the DP This is because the DP is enforcing that the elements are always added in the increasing order which does not have to be the case for the elements conducting the prefix "}

with a solution which is pretty slow but correct Let be the minimum sum of the prefix such that operations was already applied on it In order to calculate this somehow efficiently we need to understand that it s optimal to avoid intersections of segments of applied operations so we can further specify the state of with the following all applied operations have their right borders It s easy to specify the transitions we either apply set operation on and relax with or not and relax with It still so we d like to optimize it more and we can do it using the lambda optimization i e aliens trick Here we will try to describe what aliens trick is and the features of its application on the discrete calculations In general aliens trick allows you to get rid of the restriction on the total number of operations applied to the array sometimes it s the number of segments in the partition of the array by replacing it with the binary search of the value connected to it The is the cost of using the operation or the cost to use one more segment in the partition In other words we can use as many operations as we want but we need to pay for each of them Often we can calculate the answer without the restriction faster The main restriction of the using this dp optimization is the following in case of the discrete model consider the answer for the fixed or If we look at the function it should be somewhat convex i e or sometimes for all possible Let s look at the answers of the modified version of the problem with cost for each used operation as function It s easy to prove that and it s also somewhat convex for a fixed as a sum of convex functions But more important it has the following property let be the position where the is the minimum possible It can be proven from the convex property that This property leads to the solution binary search while keeping track of the i e find the minimum that But there are several problems related to the discrete origin of the problem The is not unique In general case there is a segment where the minimum can be achieved But there is still a property that and So we need to ensure that we will always find either minimum such or maximum such The second problem comes from the first one There are situations when It creates a problem in the next situation suppose the binary search finished with the and But we need to use exactly operations what to do Using float values will not help so we don t need them so we ll use usual integer bs Suppose we minimized the then we can show that or in other words So we can claim that we calculated the value not only for but also for In the end if we can efficiently calculate and for the fixed then we can binary search extract and claim that the Finally let s discuss how to calculate and for a fixed Since is just a minimum cost and the is the minimum number of operations with such cost We can calculate it by simplifying our starting Remember the cost is calculated in a next way for each remaining in we pay and for each used operation we pay Let where is minimum cost on the prefix of length and is minimum number of operations can be achieved Then the transitions are almost the same we either let be and relax with or start new operation and relax with The result is pair Some additional information we should carefully choose the borders of the binary search we should choose the left border so it s optimal to use operation whenever we can usually or And we should choose the right border so it s never optimal to use even one operation usually more than the

the gcd of the sequence bigger than we need to make all numbers even Now the problem is reduced to the following problem Given a sequence of zero or one in one move we can change numbers with numbers

Our answer will always have size First suppose that is odd Add the first index to our set that is make Now for the remaining elements we will consider them consecutively in pairs Suppose we are at the moment inspecting and If we make else we make Why does this subset work Well it satisfies the condition for because each time for consecutive non intersecting pairs of elements we select the bigger one and we also add to the set so in the end the sum of the selected elements will be bigger than the sum of the remaining ones It also satisfies the condition for because is equal or greater than the complement element of that is the index which we could ve selected instead of from the above procedure if we selected then it would be and vice versa Similarly is greater than the complement of and so on In the end we also add the last element from the last pair and this makes the sum of the chosen subset strictly bigger than the sum of the remaining elements The case when is even can be done

the string can be turned into a correct bracket sequence without these operations as follows let s turn the substring we have removed into a correct bracket sequence as it was described above then

a flow network with vertices a vertex for every character of the string a source and a sink Using the edges of the network we will try to model the following if we paint the th character red we lose coins we can treat it as always gaining coins no matter what and then losing coins instead of earning them for coloring the characters if we paint the th character blue we lose coins the same applies here if and both and are red we lose coin To model the third constraint let s say that the vertices representing s are red if they belong to the set in the cut or blue if they belong to For the vertices representing s this will be the opposite they will be red if they belong to the set or blue if they belong to the set So if we add a directed edge with capacity from to when and this edge will be cut exactly when both and are red and they create an inversion To model the second constraint for vertices representing s add an incoming edge from the source with capacity and an outgoing edge to the sink with capacity For vertices representing s this will be vice versa since red vertices representing s belong to the edge from the source to that vertex should have capacity not Now we got ourselves a flow network The answer to the problem will be where is the minimum cut in this network But instead of searching for the minimum cut we will try to calculate the maximum flow We are going to do it greedily Let s process the vertices of the network from the vertex representing the st character to the vertex representing the th character Every time we will try to push as much flow as possible through the current vertex When processing a vertex first of all let s try to push flow through the edges connecting the source and the sink with it Then if it is a vertex with a character of type let s remember that we can push flow through it to successive vertices of type let s call this excess flow for that vertex And if it is a vertex representing a character of type let s try to push at most flow into it from the vertices of type we processed earlier but no more than unit of flow from each vertex But when we process a vertex of type how do we choose from which vertices of type we take the flow It can be shown that we can take unit of flow from the vertices with the maximum amount of excess flow the formal proof is kinda long but the main idea is that every optimal flow assignment can be transformed into the one working in this greedy way without breaking anything So to recap when we process a vertex of type we remember that it has some excess flow And when we process a vertex of type we take unit of excess flow from several vertices with the maximum amount of excess flow So we need a data structure that allows us to process the following queries add an integer calculate the number of positive integers in the structure subtract from maximum integers in the structure Model implementation of this data structure is kinda long there are easier ways to do it but I will describe it nevertheless We will use an explicit key treap which stores two values in each vertex an integer belonging to the structure and the quantity of that integer in the structure so it s kinda like a map which counts the number of occurrences of each integer This treap has to support adding to all values in some subtree with lazy propagation Most operations with it are fairly straightforward but how do we actually subtract from maximum values in the tree We will do it in the following way split the treap to extract maximum elements let s denote the first treap as the part without maximums and the second treap as the part with those maximums add to the values in the second treap while the minimum element in the second treap is not greater than the maximum element in the first treap remove the minimum from the second treap and insert it into the first treap merge the treaps It s quite easy to see that if you store the pairs of the form element the number of its occurrences in the treap the third step will require moving at most elements And the resulting complexity of every operation with this data structure becomes so the whole solution works in "}

well Thus this statement is proved Statement 2 if then either or or such that and Show it We will call subsegments consisting of several consecutive numbers in some order Consider some kind of permutation of length of beauty Suppose that We want to show that in the permutation there is some good subsegment of length not equal to or with the following property for any other good subsegment if and intersect then one of them contains the second In this case by analogy with the proof of Proposition 1 we can squeeze the segment into one element obtaining some kind of permutation Then the number of good segments in the entire permutation will be equal to the number of good sub segments on the segment the number of good segments in since we counted the segment twice We will call such a segment Thus if in each permutation there is then the statement is true Let be a good segment that is not very good Then there is a good segment which intersects with but does not contain and is not contained in it The segments and form together segment It is easy to show that each of them is good and the numbers in the segments go monotonously Let us demonstrate this with an example the first segment is the second is Then together they will give the union of three segments As we can see each of these segments is good and also all numbers in the second segment are larger than all numbers in the first all numbers in the third segment are larger than all numbers in the second Let at the moment we have lined up a chain of good segments going consecutively where the union of any several consecutive ones is a good segment as well as all the numbers in more than all the numbers in or vice versa As long as is not equal to the whole segment we will do this since is very good there is a segment that intersects with it but is not contained in it does not contain It is easy to see that thanks to the segment our chain of good segments is extended Now suppose that is the whole segment While there is a segment of length greater than among the segments we will do the same if then we will find the necessary for it then will be split into two smaller good segments At the end of the process we get good segments of length each and the numbers are sorted monotonously Hence the numbers in the permutation were initially sorted monotonously whence the number of good segments is The statement is proved Now the left is easy for each from to we calculate what beauty values can be in a permutation of length using statement storing the corresponding values After that it is easy to answer the request by building a permutation of the desired beauty according to the algorithm with the approval of Asymptotics of With an incredibly small constant up to on this works for 300 ms

tree of the graph whose structure represents the sequence of mergings of connected components in the algorithm Each vertex in the reachability tree corresponds to some connected component at some point in time in the algorithm Each non leaf vertex in the reachability tree always has two children which are the two connected components that are merged to form the connected component represented by that vertex so every time two connected components merge in the algorithm we make a new vertex in the reachability tree that is connected to its two corresponding children After doing all that we ve constructed a reachability tree that is a rooted binary tree with 2n 1 vertices n of which are leaves For each non leaf vertex x we write down weight x which is the weight of the edge that forms its connected component For each leaf we mark it as special if and only if it corresponds to a house that needs internet Then for each vertex x we calculate cnt x which is the number of special leaves in the subtree of x These values will be used later Consider a non leaf x in the reachability tree It can be obtained that two vertices in the original graph corresponding to any two leaves in the subtree of x can have a path between them in the original graph with a weight of at most weight x Let s solve for some value of k For each special vertex x we want to choose a target vertex y that s an ancestor of x Then we choose a set of k leaves for the houses with installed servers We want it such that each chosen target has at least one leaf in its subtree that is a member of the set The total path cost of this is the sum of weight y for all chosen targets y Let s say we ve fixed the set of k leaves Then we mark every ancestor of these leaves If we only consider the marked vertices with the edges between them we have a reduced tree For each special leaf we want to choose its nearest ancestor that is in the reduced tree for its target to get the one with the smallest weight Knowing this we can solve the problem in another point of view Initially we have the original reachability tree We want to reduce it into a reduced tree with k leaves We want to do it while maintaining the chosen targets of the special leaves and their costs Initially for each special leaf we choose itself as its target In one operation we can do the following Choose a vertex that s currently a leaf Move every target that s currently in that leaf to its parent Remove that leaf and the edge connecting it to its parent We want to do that until the reduced tree has k leaves For each edge connecting a vertex x to its parent y in the reachability tree calculate weight y weight x cnt x That is the cost to move every target in vertex x to vertex y Define that as the edge s length We want to do operations with the minimum cost so that the reduced tree has k leaves We want to minimize the sum of lengths of the deleted edges If we look at it in a different way we want to choose edges to be in the reduced tree with the maximum sum of lengths For some value of k the edges of the reduced tree can be decomposed into k paths from some vertex to its descendant We want the total sum of lengths of these paths to be as big as possible But how do we solve it for every k from 1 to n Let s say k 1 We can choose the path from the root to its furthest leaf How do we solve for k 2 onwards It turns out that we can use the optimal solution for some value of k to make the optimal solution for k 1 by just adding the longest possible available path That means for each k from 1 to n we just find the current longest available path and add it to our reduced tree What if at some point there are more than one possible longest paths It can be proven that we can choose any of these paths and the optimal solutions for the next values of k will still be optimal The proof for this greedy strategy involves the convexity of the total length as k goes from 1 to n However we won t explain it in detail here So to solve the problem we do DFS in the reachability tree to calculate for each vertex x the furthest leaf and the second furthest leaf in its subtree For each k from 1 to n we add the current longest available path using this precalculation Time complexity O nlogn mlogm "}

exactly has 2 incoming edges the graph will meet the requirement We will use mathematical induction method to prove the lemma For an arbitrary node we suppose that all nodes whose distance is less

can end up in any point from to units along the ray That makes it a segment So the collision can happen if some pair of segments intersects Let s learn how to find that out The general idea is to use sweep line So let s add the events that the th segment such that opens at and closes at There were no vertical segments so and are always different At every moment of time we want to maintain the segments ordered by their intersection with the line Note that if two segments change their order moving along the sweep line then they intersect So we can maintain a set with a custom comparator that returns if one segment intersects the current line lower than the other one When adding a segment to set you want to check it s intersections with the next segment in the order and the previous one When removing a segment you want to check the intersection between the next and the previous segment in the order If any check triggers then return true immediately It s easy to show that if the intersection happens between some pair of segments then the intersection between only these pairs of segment also happens Now for the implementation details Precision errors play a huge role here since we use binary search and also store some stuff dependant on floats in the set The solution I want to tell requires no epsilon comparisons thus it calculates the answer only with the precision of binary search So the first issue rises when we have to erase elements from the set Notice that we can make a mistake when we are adding the segment and there is a segment with almost the same intersection point That will not make the answer incorrect that s not trivial to show but it s possible if you consider some cases If you can find it later to remove then it s not an issue at all However that will probably mess up the lower bound in the set Thus let s save the pointer to each element in the set and remove it later by that pointer The second issue comes when you have to check the intersection of two segments The error might appear when one segment let the first point be the original and the second point be calculated depending on has it s intersection point with segment at exactly So the slightest miscalculations could matter a lot Let s learn to intersect in such a way that no epsilon comparisons are required Firstly we can store lines in the set instead of segments Second we can check the intersection of rays first and only then proceed to check the intersection of segments So two rays intersect if their lines intersect easy to check in integers the intersection point lies in the correct direction of both rays the intersection point is always a pair of fractions and you want to compare the signs of and Finally if all the checks hold then you can compare maximum of distances from and to the intersection point and If is greater or equal then they intersect in time There is no way to make that comparison in integers However it s precision only depends on the precision of as in the error here can t affect the answer greatly Overall complexity "}

have some common prefix and it has already been included in the largest increasing subsequence then we can drop the prefixes of the suffix and instead of them write exactly the same suffix prefixes of and the size of the increasing subsequence will not change and the condition above will be satisfied If however the suffixes and have no common prefix then we could take the suffix itself together with its prefixes and the answer would only improve Thus the largest increasing subsequence looks like this first comes some substring followed by a substring and so on ending with the suffix After that comes some substring followed by a substring and so on ending with the suffix and so on Moreover knowing which suffixes are included in this subsequence we can establish all other substrings Indeed let the suffixes and be included in the sequence and Then it is not difficult to see that the suffix prefixes can be typed greedily namely to take all substring such that they are larger than the suffix Note that if the substring is larger than the suffix then the substring is also larger than the suffix And so we can use the following algorithm to find out that is to find out which suffix prefix to start typing the subsequence Let be the size of the largest common prefix of suffixes and Then it is easy to see that if the suffix is larger than the suffix then the appropriate is which means that you must start typing all substrings starting from the one that differs from the largest common prefix of the two suffixes So now we are left with two problems The first is you have to learn to quickly recognize the greatest common prefix of the two suffixes The second is to write a DP that would allow you to recognize the answer Let s see how to solve the first problem You can use different string algorties such as a suffix array Or we can write a simple DP that calculates an array of the largest common prefixes over The transitions in this DP and its implementation can be seen in the author s solution code lines 37 48 Now about the DP that calculates the answer Let us use the facts above and do the following Let denote the size of the answer if the last substring in it is the suffix Let and then Now let s do the following We will go through from to doing the following simple steps for each from to denotes the previous suffix in the answer we will check how many substring of the suffix we can take if the suffix is larger than the suffix we calculate this number with the above described algorithm using the array of largest common prefixes Otherwise we will not update because the suffix is less than or equal to the suffix we cannot take it in response It is not difficult to guess that the answer is maximal in all Thus the problem is solved using two uncomplicated dynamics Asymptotics per test case "}
