Gildong is experimenting with an interesting machine In Graph Traveler there is a directed graph consisting of n vertices numbered from 1 to n The i th vertex has m i outgoing edges that are labeled as e i 0 e i 1 ldots e i m i 1 each representing the destination vertex of the edge The graph can have multiple edges and self loops The i th vertex also has an integer k i written on itself A on this graph works as follows Gildong chooses a vertex to start from and an integer to start with Set the variable c to this integer After arriving at the vertex i or when Gildong begins the travel at some vertex i add k i to c The next vertex is e i x where x is an integer 0 le x le m i 1 satisfying x equiv c pmod m i Go to the next vertex and go back to step 2 It s obvious that a travel never ends since the 2nd and the 3rd step will be repeated endlessly For example assume that Gildong starts at vertex 1 with c 5 and m 1 2 e 1 0 1 e 1 1 2 k 1 3 Right after he starts at vertex 1 c becomes 2 Since the only integer x 0 le x le 1 where x equiv c pmod m i is 0 Gildong goes to vertex e 1 0 1 After arriving at vertex 1 again c becomes 1 The only integer x satisfying the conditions is 1 so he goes to vertex e 1 1 2 and so on Since Gildong is quite inquisitive he s going to ask you q queries He wants to know how many vertices will be visited if he starts the travel from a certain vertex with a certain value of c Note that you should count the vertices that will be visited only finite times ,"[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]",0.045966241508722305,0.1344599637619624,0.13919439126075484,0.2034610981459035,0.672061606398567,0.17071115100671266,0.03384326982397363,0.2325057699141912,0.020215844326175337,0.3893586583122781,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9]"

You are an intergalactic surgeon and you have an alien patient For the purposes of this problem we can and we will model this patient s body using a 2 times 2k 1 rectangular grid The alien has 4k 1 distinct organs numbered 1 to 4k 1 In healthy such aliens the organs are arranged in a particular way For example here is how the organs of a healthy such alien would be positioned when viewed from the top for k 4 Here the represents empty space In general the first row contains organs 1 to 2k 1 in that order from left to right and the second row contains organs 2k 2 to 4k 1 in that order from left to right and then empty space right after Your patient s organs are complete and inside their body but they somehow got shuffled around Your job as an intergalactic surgeon is to put everything back in its correct position All organs of the alien must be in its body during the entire procedure This means that at any point during the procedure there is exactly one cell in the grid that is empty In addition you can only move organs around by doing one of the following things You can switch the positions of the empty space with any organ to its immediate left or to its immediate right if they exist In reality you do this by sliding the organ in question to the empty space You can switch the positions of the empty space with any organ to its immediate top or its immediate bottom if they exist the empty space is on the column column or in the column Again you do this by sliding the organ in question to the empty space Your job is to figure out a sequence of moves you must do during the surgical procedure in order to place back all 4k 1 internal organs of your patient in the correct cells If it is impossible to do so you must say so ,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",0.05122803896665573,0.23647515957322937,0.8464504851964164,0.040817616767852734,0.06433048514080544,0.2338463718178151,0.3601548263051539,0.0036102543990345726,0.002047199541626283,0.022371359366845693,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[1, 6]"

Mahmoud wrote a message of length He wants to send it as a birthday present to his friend Moaz who likes strings He wrote it on a magical paper but he was surprised because some characters disappeared while writing the string That s because this magical paper doesn t allow character number in the English alphabet to be written on it in a string of length more than For example if he can t write character on this paper in a string of length or more String is allowed while string is not Mahmoud decided to split the message into some non empty substrings so that he can write every substring on an independent magical paper and fulfill the condition The sum of their lengths should be and they shouldn t overlap For example if and he wants to send string he can split it into and and use magical papers or into and and use magical papers He can t split it into and because the sum of their lengths is greater than He can split the message into single string if it fulfills the conditions A substring of string is a string that consists of some consecutive characters from string strings and are substrings of string while strings and are not Any string is a substring of itself While Mahmoud was thinking of how to split the message Ehab told him that there are many ways to split it After that Mahmoud asked you three questions How many ways are there to split the string into substrings such that every substring fulfills the condition of the magical paper the sum of their lengths is and they don t overlap Compute the answer modulo What is the maximum length of a substring that can appear in some valid splitting What is the minimum number of substrings the message can be spit in Two ways are considered different if the sets of split positions differ For example splitting and are considered different splittings of message ,"[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0.12432167679071426,0.16055336809120563,0.08534350769833973,0.9616900979046535,0.1628897381842055,0.07799145552698074,0.019524471898163014,0.05575311491036351,0.01088062750923234,0.03503954627227909,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"[0, 3, 5]"

Emuskald was hired to design an artificial waterfall according to the latest trends in landscape architecture A modern artificial waterfall consists of multiple horizontal panels affixed to a wide flat wall The water flows down the top of the wall from panel to panel until it reaches the bottom of the wall The wall has height and has panels on the wall Each panel is a horizontal segment at height which begins at and ends at The th panel connects the points and of the plane The top of the wall can be considered a panel connecting the points and Similarly the bottom of the wall can be considered a panel connecting the points and No two panels share a common point Emuskald knows that for the waterfall to be aesthetically pleasing it can flow from panel to panel only if the following conditions hold horizontal projections of the panels overlap panel is below panel there is no such panel that the first two conditions hold for the pairs and Then the for is equal to the length of their horizontal projection overlap Emuskald has decided that in his waterfall the water will flow in a single path from top to bottom If water flows to a panel except the bottom of the wall the water will fall further to lower panel The total amount of water flow in the waterfall is then defined as the minimum horizontal projection overlap between two consecutive panels in the path of the waterfall Formally the waterfall consists of a single path of panels the flow of the waterfall is the minimum flow in the path To make a truly great waterfall Emuskald must maximize this water flow but there are too many panels and he is having a hard time planning his creation Below is an example of a waterfall Emuskald wants Help Emuskald maintain his reputation and find the value of the maximum possible water flow ,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]",0.16586410999298096,0.0814984551999558,0.13108365806872133,0.46759666108556186,0.738343167352722,0.08217728179584674,0.0299912125535428,0.32213264242868656,0.0439561399441686,0.06583344435994366,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,"[3, 4, 8, 9]"

My name is James diGriz I m the most clever robber and treasure hunter in the whole galaxy There are books written about my adventures and songs about my operations though you were able to catch me up in a pretty awkward moment I was able to hide from cameras outsmart all the guards and pass numerous traps but when I finally reached the treasure box and opened it I have accidentally started the clockwork bomb Luckily I have met such kind of bombs before and I know that the clockwork mechanism can be stopped by connecting contacts with wires on the control panel of the bomb in a certain manner I see contacts connected by wires Contacts are numbered with integers from to Bomb has a security mechanism that ensures the following condition if there exist contacts forming a circuit i e there exist wires between contacts and and and then the bomb immediately explodes and my story ends here In particular if two contacts are connected by more than one wire they form a circuit of length It is also prohibited to connect a contact with itself On the other hand if I disconnect more than one wire i e at some moment there will be no more than wires in the scheme then the other security check fails and the bomb also explodes So the only thing I can do is to unplug some wire and plug it into a new place ensuring the fact that no circuits appear I know how I should put the wires in order to stop the clockwork But my time is running out Help me get out of this alive find the sequence of operations each of which consists of unplugging some wire and putting it into another place so that the bomb is defused ,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0.8285115361213684,0.10333806420735987,0.1892033932041477,0.07750256810507165,0.05196445308544938,0.1427057946151389,0.7167730619305066,0.01883220148833011,0.0308154317189227,0.3544731155787784,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[0, 4]"

Piet is one of the most known visual esoteric programming languages The programs in Piet are constructed from colorful blocks of pixels and interpreted using pretty complicated rules In this problem we will use a subset of Piet language with simplified rules The program will be a rectangular image consisting of colored and black pixels The color of each pixel will be given by an integer number between 0 and 9 inclusive with 0 denoting black A block of pixels is defined as a rectangle of pixels of the same color not black It is guaranteed that all connected groups of colored pixels of the same color will form rectangular blocks Groups of black pixels can form arbitrary shapes The program is interpreted using movement of instruction pointer IP which consists of three parts current block pointer BP note that there is no concept of current pixel within the block direction pointer DP which can point left right up or down block chooser CP which can point to the left or to the right from the direction given by DP in absolute values CP can differ from DP by 90 degrees counterclockwise or clockwise respectively Initially BP points to the block which contains the top left corner of the program DP points to the right and CP points to the left see the orange square on the image below One step of program interpretation changes the state of IP in a following way The interpreter finds the furthest edge of the current color block in the direction of the DP From all pixels that form this edge the interpreter selects the furthest one in the direction of After this BP attempts to move from this pixel into the next one in the direction of DP If the next pixel belongs to a colored block this block becomes the current one and two other parts of IP stay the same It the next pixel is black or outside of the program BP stays the same but two other parts of IP change If CP was pointing to the left now it points to the right and DP stays the same If CP was pointing to the right now it points to the left and DP is rotated 90 degrees clockwise This way BP will never point to a black block it is guaranteed that top left pixel of the program will not be black You are given a Piet program You have to figure out which block of the program will be current after steps ,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0.1998095065355301,0.01714290163629686,0.46361845657490725,0.12658805953317162,0.822292873501266,0.06693124047818208,0.11043768340307074,0.07503016373542035,0.008637486494749503,0.038475529378777656,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,[2]

The new generation external memory contains an array of integers a 1 ldots n a 1 a 2 ldots a n This type of memory does not support changing the value of an arbitrary element Instead it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array rotate it by any offset and insert it back into the same place Technically each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions You may select arbitrary indices l and r 1 le l r le n as the boundaries of the segment Then you replace the segment a l ldots r with it s to the by an arbitrary offset d The concept of a can be also explained by following relations the sequence 1 4 1 3 is a cyclic shift of the sequence 3 1 4 1 to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence 4 1 3 1 is a cyclic shift of the sequence 3 1 4 1 to the left by the offset 2 For example if a 1 color blue 3 2 8 5 then choosing l 2 r 4 and d 2 yields a segment a 2 ldots 4 3 2 8 This segment is then shifted by the offset d 2 to the and you get a segment 8 3 2 which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment In the end you get a 1 color blue 8 3 2 5 Sort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments Note that you don t need to minimize the number of cyclic shifts Any method that requires n or less cyclic shifts will be accepted ,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",0.6692956686019897,0.10652178968179311,0.16976417427087362,0.05517423943553416,0.37605322861795387,0.06673407930466875,0.2905265442728803,0.12652904281726368,0.7391891863476737,0.12258795235042148,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[2, 8]"

Bosco is studying the behaviour of particles He decided to investigate on the peculiar behaviour of the so called four one two particle He does the following There is a line of length n 1 where the topmost point is position 0 and bottommost is position n 1 The particle is initially at time t 0 at position 0 and heading downwards The particle moves at the speed of 1 unit per second There are n oscillators at positions 1 2 ldots n Each oscillator can be described by a binary string The initial state of each oscillator is the first character of its binary string When the particle hits with an oscillator the particle reverses its direction if its current state is texttt 1 and continues to move at the same direction if its current state is texttt 0 and that oscillator moves on to the next state the next state of the last state is defined as the first state Additionally the particle always reverses its direction when it is at position 0 or n 1 at time t 0 Bosco would like to know the cycle length of the movement of particle The cycle length is defined as the minimum value of c such that for any time t ge 0 the position of the particle at time t is same as the position of the particle at time t c It can be proved that such value c always exists As he realises the answer might be too large he asks you to output your answer modulo 998244353 ,"[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0.059046853333711624,0.4617809171337246,0.09244996423338805,0.9228001691805034,0.0561624216186593,0.14514331171745645,0.02317609960111765,0.014079218839205185,0.01255733644034429,0.039941592630811595,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1, 3]"

Stitch likes experimenting with different machines with his friend Sparky Today they built another machine The main element of this machine are n rods arranged along one straight line and numbered from 1 to n inclusive Each of these rods must carry an electric charge quantitatively equal to either 1 or 1 otherwise the machine will not work Another condition for this machine to work is that the sign variable sum of the charge on all rods must be zero More formally the rods can be represented as an array of n numbers characterizing the charge either 1 or 1 Then the condition must hold a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 ldots 0 or sum limits i 1 n 1 i 1 cdot a i 0 Sparky charged all n rods with an electric current but unfortunately it happened that the rods were not charged correctly the sign variable sum of the charge is not zero The friends decided to leave only some of the rods in the machine Sparky has q questions In the ith question Sparky asks if the machine consisted only of rods with numbers l i to r i inclusive what minimal number of rods could be removed from the machine so that the sign variable sum of charges on the remaining ones would be zero Perhaps the friends got something wrong and the sign variable sum is already zero In that case you don t have to remove the rods at all If the number of rods is zero we will assume that the sign variable sum of charges is zero that is we can always remove all rods Help your friends and answer all of Sparky s questions ,"[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0.19108673930168152,0.17510518530465008,0.18820632488648925,0.20267520539606793,0.6835402391884656,0.11342180097590389,0.03896694105860726,0.41499866623204773,0.050843028202902575,0.01418863079381333,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[1, 3, 4]"

Attention we lost all the test cases for this problem so instead of solving the problem we need you to generate test cases We re going to give you the answer and you need to print a test case that produces the given answer The original problem is in the following paragraph People don t use cash as often as they used to Having a credit card solves some of the hassles of cash such as having to receive change when you can t form the exact amount of money needed to purchase an item Typically cashiers will give you as few coins as possible in change but they don t have to For example if your change is 30 cents a cashier could give you a 5 cent piece and a 25 cent piece or they could give you three 10 cent pieces or ten 1 cent pieces two 5 cent pieces and one 10 cent piece Altogether there are 18 different ways to make 30 cents using only 1 cent pieces 5 cent pieces 10 cent pieces and 25 cent pieces Two ways are considered different if they contain a different number of at least one type of coin Given the denominations of the coins and an amount of change to be made how many different ways are there to make change As we mentioned before we lost all the test cases for this problem so we re actually going to give you the number of ways and want you to produce a test case for which the number of ways is the given number There could be many ways to achieve this we guarantee there s always at least one so you can print any as long as it meets the constraints described below ,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",0.3452701270580292,0.7869009005598958,0.2799505478455715,0.06641427424231212,0.019549001219319788,0.39247711143384784,0.05015538578760718,0.028003927447747677,0.011685904004946292,0.0015246468362927394,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[1, 6]"

After years of hard work scientists invented an absolutely new e reader display The new display has a larger resolution consumes less energy and its production is cheaper And besides one can bend it The only inconvenience is highly unusual management For that very reason the developers decided to leave the e readers software to programmers The display is represented by square of pixels each of which can be either black or white The display rows are numbered with integers from to upside down the columns are numbered with integers from to from the left to the right The display can perform commands like When a traditional display fulfills such command it simply inverts a color of where is the row number and is the column number But in our new display every pixel that belongs to at least one of the segments and both ends of both segments are included inverts a color For example if initially a display in size is absolutely white then the sequence of commands leads to the following changes You are an e reader software programmer and you should calculate minimal number of commands needed to display the picture You can regard all display pixels as initially white ,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",0.7665219306945801,0.04509387182393328,0.4232180200194103,0.9117228463920408,0.46492205515362167,0.10564506270241658,0.015577902329852471,0.08006193914206113,0.005268956577300814,0.007307192946120288,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[0, 6]"

Recently Polycarp was given an unusual typewriter as a gift Unfortunately the typewriter was defective and had a rather strange design The typewriter consists of n cells numbered from left to right from 1 to n and a carriage that moves over them The typewriter cells contain n integers from 1 to n and each cell i initially contains the integer p i Before all actions the carriage is at cell number 1 and there is nothing in its buffer storage The cell on which the carriage is located is called the cell The carriage can perform five types of operations Take the integer from the current cell if it is not empty and put it in the carriage buffer if it is empty this buffer can contain integer Put the integer from the carriage buffer if it is not empty into the current cell if it is empty Swap the number in the carriage buffer with the number in the current cell if both the buffer and the cell contain integers Move the carriage from the current cell i to cell i 1 if i n while the integer in the buffer is preserved Reset the carriage i e move it to cell number 1 while the integer in the buffer is preserved Polycarp was very interested in this typewriter so he asks you to help him understand it and will ask you q queries of three types Perform a cyclic shift of the sequence p to the left by k j Perform a cyclic shift of the sequence p to the right by k j Reverse the sequence p Before and after each query Polycarp wants to know what number of carriage resets is needed for the current sequence in order to distribute the numbers to their cells so that the number i ends up in cell number i Note that Polycarp only wants to know the minimum number of carriage resets required to arrange the numbers in their places but Help Polycarp find the answers to his queries ,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0.09190554916858673,0.11497271080685265,0.22482725971623374,0.10629592234810332,0.8278222343526002,0.11839033792407269,0.052776301737098345,0.2643679291702552,0.03419763277080338,0.022425817168087052,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"[1, 5]"
