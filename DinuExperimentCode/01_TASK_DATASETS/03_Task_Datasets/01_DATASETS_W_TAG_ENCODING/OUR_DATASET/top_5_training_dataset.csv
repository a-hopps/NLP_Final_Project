Programmer Sasha is a student at MIPT Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and he needs to make a laboratory work to pass his finals A laboratory unit is a plane with standard coordinate axes marked on it Physicists from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology charged the axes by large electric charges axis is positive and axis is negative Experienced laboratory worker marked points with integer coordinates on the plane and stopped the time Sasha should use atomic tweezers to place elementary particles in these points He has an unlimited number of electrons negatively charged elementary particles and protons positively charged elementary particles He can put either an electron or a proton at each marked point As soon as all marked points are filled with particles laboratory worker will turn on the time again and the particles will come in motion and after some time they will stabilize in equilibrium The objective of the laboratory work is to arrange the particles in such a way that the diameter of the resulting state the maximum distance between the pairs of points of the set is as small as possible Since Sasha is a programmer he naively thinks that all the particles will simply fall into their projections on the corresponding axes electrons will fall on axis while protons will fall on axis As we are programmers too we will consider the same model as Sasha That is a As the laboratory has high background radiation and Sasha takes care of his laptop he did not take it with him and now he can t write a program that computes the minimum possible diameter of the resulting set Therefore you will have to do it for him Print a of the minimum possible diameter of the set ,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
Polycarpus develops an interesting theory about the interrelation of arithmetic progressions with just everything in the world His current idea is that the population of the capital of Berland changes over time like an arithmetic progression Well or like multiple arithmetic progressions Polycarpus believes that if he writes out the population of the capital for several consecutive years in the sequence then it is convenient to consider the array as several arithmetic progressions written one after the other For example sequence can be considered as a sequence of three arithmetic progressions and which are written one after another Unfortunately Polycarpus may not have all the data for the consecutive years a census of the population doesn t occur every year after all For this reason some values of may be unknown Such values are represented by number For a given sequence which consists of positive integers and values find the minimum number of arithmetic progressions Polycarpus needs to get To get the progressions need to be written down one after the other Values may correspond to an arbitrary positive integer and the values must be equal to the corresponding elements of sought consecutive record of the progressions Let us remind you that a finite sequence is called an arithmetic progression if the difference of any two consecutive elements in it is constant By definition any sequence of length 1 is an arithmetic progression ,"[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]"

Vasily has recently learned about the amazing properties of number In one of the articles it has been hypothesized that whatever the sequence of numbers we have in some position this sequence is found among the digits of number Thus if you take for example the epic novel War and Peace of famous Russian author Leo Tolstoy and encode it with numbers then we will find the novel among the characters of number Vasily was absolutely delighted with this because it means that all the books songs and programs have already been written and encoded in the digits of Vasily is of course a bit wary that this is only a hypothesis and it hasn t been proved so he decided to check it out To do this Vasily downloaded from the Internet the archive with the sequence of digits of number starting with a certain position and began to check the different strings of digits on the presence in the downloaded archive Vasily quickly found short strings of digits but each time he took a longer string it turned out that it is not in the archive Vasily came up with a definition that a string of length is a if it contains a substring of length of at least which occurs in the archive To complete the investigation Vasily took large numbers with the same number of digits and now he wants to find the number of numbers in the interval from to which are in the archive Help Vasily calculate this value modulo ,"[0, 0, 1, 1, 0]"

Vasya is pressing the keys on the keyboard reluctantly squeezing out his ideas on the classical epos depicted in Homer s Odysseus How can he explain to his literature teacher that he isn t going to become a writer In fact he is going to become a programmer So he would take great pleasure in writing a program but none in writing a composition As Vasya was fishing for a sentence in the dark pond of his imagination he suddenly wondered what is the least number of times he should push a key to shift the cursor from one position to another one Let s describe his question more formally to type a text Vasya is using the text editor He has already written lines the th line contains characters including spaces If some line contains characters then this line overall contains positions where the cursor can stand before some character or after all characters at the end of the line Thus the cursor s position is determined by a pair of integers where is the number of the line and is the cursor s position in the line the positions are indexed starting from one from the beginning of the line Vasya doesn t use the mouse to move the cursor He uses keys Up Down Right and Left When he pushes each of these keys the cursor shifts in the needed direction Let s assume that before the corresponding key is pressed the cursor was located in the position then Vasya pushed key Up if the cursor was located in the first line then it does not move Otherwise it moves to the previous line with number to the same position At that if the previous line was short that is the cursor couldn t occupy position there the cursor moves to the last position of the line with number Down if the cursor was located in the last line then it does not move Otherwise it moves to the next line with number to the same position At that if the next line was short that is the cursor couldn t occupy position there the cursor moves to the last position of the line with number Right if the cursor can move to the right in this line then it moves to the right to position Otherwise it is located at the end of the line and doesn t move anywhere when Vasya presses the Right key Left if the cursor can move to the left in this line then it moves to the left to position Otherwise it is located at the beginning of the line and doesn t move anywhere when Vasya presses the Left key You ve got the number of lines in the text file and the number of characters written in each line of this file Find the least number of times Vasya should push the keys described above to shift the cursor from position to position ,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

The development of a text editor is a hard problem You need to implement an extra module for brackets coloring in text Your editor consists of a line with infinite length and cursor which points to the current character Please note that it points to only one of the characters and not between a pair of characters Thus it points to an index character The user can move the cursor left or right one position If the cursor is already at the first leftmost position then it does not move left Initially the cursor is in the first leftmost character Also the user can write a letter or brackets either or to the position that the cursor is currently pointing at A new character always overwrites the old value at that position Your editor must check whether the current line is the Text is correct if the brackets in them form the Formally correct text CT must satisfy the following rules any line without brackets is CT the line can contain whitespaces If the first character of the string is the last is and all the rest form a CT then the whole line is a CT two consecutively written CT is also CT Examples of correct texts Examples of incorrect texts The user uses special commands to work with your editor Each command has its symbol which must be written to execute this command The correspondence of commands and characters is as follows move the cursor one character to the left remains in place if it already points to the first character move the cursor one character to the right any lowercase Latin letter or bracket or write the entered character to the position where the cursor is now For a complete understanding take a look at the first example and its illustrations in the note below You are given a string containing the characters that the user entered For the brackets coloring module s work after each command you need to check if the current text in the editor is a correct text if it is print the least number of colors that required to color all brackets If two pairs of brackets are nested the first in the second or vice versa then these pairs of brackets should be painted in colors If two pairs of brackets are not nested then they can be painted in different or the same colors For example for the bracket sequence the least number of colors is 2 and for the bracket sequence is 3 Write a program that prints the minimal number of colors after processing each command ,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]"

There are n candies in a row they are numbered from left to right from 1 to n The size of the i th candy is a i Alice and Bob play an interesting and tasty game they eat candy Alice will eat candy and Bob The game ends if all the candies are eaten The process consists of moves During a move the player eats one or more sweets from her his side Alice eats from the left Bob from the right Alice makes the first move During the first move she will eat 1 candy its size is a 1 Then each successive move the players alternate that is Bob makes the second move then Alice then again Bob and so on On each move a player counts the total size of candies eaten during the current move Once this number becomes strictly greater than the total size of candies eaten by the other player on their previous move the current player stops eating and the move ends In other words on a move a player eats the smallest possible number of candies such that the sum of the sizes of candies eaten on this move is than the sum of the sizes of candies that the other player ate on the move If there are not enough candies to make a move this way then the player eats up all the remaining candies and the game ends For example if n 11 and a 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 then move 1 Alice eats one candy of size 3 and the sequence of candies becomes 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 move 2 Alice ate 3 on the previous move which means Bob must eat 4 or more Bob eats one candy of size 5 and the sequence of candies becomes 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 move 3 Bob ate 5 on the previous move which means Alice must eat 6 or more Alice eats three candies with the total size of 1 4 1 6 and the sequence of candies becomes 5 9 2 6 5 3 move 4 Alice ate 6 on the previous move which means Bob must eat 7 or more Bob eats two candies with the total size of 3 5 8 and the sequence of candies becomes 5 9 2 6 move 5 Bob ate 8 on the previous move which means Alice must eat 9 or more Alice eats two candies with the total size of 5 9 14 and the sequence of candies becomes 2 6 move 6 the last Alice ate 14 on the previous move which means Bob must eat 15 or more It is impossible so Bob eats the two remaining candies and the game ends Print the number of moves in the game and two numbers a the total size of all sweets eaten by Alice during the game b the total size of all sweets eaten by Bob during the game ,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
Ilya has recently taken up archaeology He s recently found two numbers written in the based notation Each of the found numbers consisted of exactly digits Ilya immediately started looking for information about those numbers He learned that the numbers are part of a cyphered code and the one who can decypher it can get the greatest treasure After considerable research Ilya understood that to decypher the code he should do the following Rearrange digits in the first number in some manner Similarly rearrange digits in the second number in some manner As a result of this operation the numbers can get leading zeroes Add numbers digit by digit modulo In other words we need to get the third number of length each digit of the number is the sum of the respective numbers of the found numbers For example suppose there are two numbers recorded in the ternary notation 001210 and 012111 then if you add them to each other digit by digit modulo 3 you will get number 010021 The key to the code is the maximum possible number that can be obtained in the previous step Help Ilya find the key to the code ,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

In the last war of PMP he defeated all his opponents and advanced to the final round But after the end of semi final round evil attacked him from behind and killed him God bless him Before his death PMP signed a contract with the bus rapid transit BRT that improves public transportations by optimizing time of travel estimation You should help PMP finish his last contract Each BRT line is straight line that passes intersecting on its ways At each intersection there is traffic light that periodically cycles between green and red It starts illuminating green at time zero During the green phase which lasts for seconds traffic is allowed to proceed After the green phase the light changes to red and remains in this color for seconds During the red phase traffic is prohibited from proceeding If a vehicle reaches the intersection exactly at a time when the light changes to red it should stop but the vehicle is clear to proceed if the light has just changed to green All traffic lights have the same timing and are synchronized In other words the period of red and green phase is the same for all of traffic lights and they all start illuminating green at time zero The BRT Company has calculated the time that a bus requires to pass each road segment A road segment is the distance between two consecutive traffic lights or between a traffic light and source or destination station More precisely BRT specialists provide positive integers the time in seconds that a bus needs to traverse th road segment in the path from source to destination The value denotes the time that a bus needs to pass the distance between source and the first intersection The value denotes the time between the last intersection and destination In one day buses leave the source station The th bus starts from source at time in seconds Decision makers of BRT Company want to know what time a bus gets to destination The bus is considered as point A bus will always move if it can The buses do not interfere with each other ,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
