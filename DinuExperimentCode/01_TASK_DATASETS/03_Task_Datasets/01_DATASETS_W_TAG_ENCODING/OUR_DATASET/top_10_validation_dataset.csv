Nanami is an expert at playing games This day Nanami s good friend Hajime invited her to watch a game of baseball Unwilling as she was she followed him to the stadium But Nanami had no interest in the game so she looked around to see if there was something that might interest her That s when she saw the digital board at one end of the stadium The digital board is pixels in height and pixels in width every pixel is either light or dark The pixels are described by its coordinate The th pixel of the th line is pixel The board displays messages by switching a combination of pixels to light and the rest to dark Nanami notices that the state of the pixels on the board changes from time to time At certain times certain pixels on the board may switch from light to dark or from dark to light Nanami wonders what is the area of the biggest light block such that a specific pixel is on its side A light block is a sub rectangle of the board in which all pixels are light Pixel belongs to a side of sub rectangle with and as its upper left and lower right vertex if and only if it satisfies the logical condition or and or or and Nanami has all the history of changing pixels also she has some questions of the described type can you answer them ,"[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Petya and his friend the robot Petya went to BFDMONCON where the costume contest is taking place today While walking through the festival they came across a scientific stand named after Professor Oak and Golfball where they were asked to solve an interesting problem Given a sequence of numbers a 1 a 2 dots a n you can perform several operations on this sequence Each operation should look as follows You choose some subsequence dagger Then you call all the numbers at odd positions in this subsequence and all the numbers at even positions in this subsequence In this case only the position of the number in the subsequence is taken into account not in the original sequence For example consider the sequence 1 4 2 8 5 7 3 6 9 and its subsequence shown in bold 1 mathbf 4 mathbf 2 8 mathbf 5 7 3 mathbf 6 9 Then the numbers 4 and 5 are and the numbers 2 and 6 are After that you can do one of the following add 1 to all northern numbers and subtract 1 from all south numbers or add 1 to all southern numbers and subtract 1 from all northern numbers Thus from the sequence 1 mathbf 4 mathbf 2 8 mathbf 5 7 3 mathbf 6 9 if you choose the subsequence shown in bold you can get either 1 mathbf 5 mathbf 1 8 mathbf 6 7 3 mathbf 5 9 or 1 mathbf 3 mathbf 3 8 mathbf 4 7 3 mathbf 7 9 Then the operation ends Note also that all operations are independent i e the numbers are no longer called or when one operation ends It is necessary to turn all the numbers of the sequence into zeros using the operations described above Since there is very little time left before the costume contest the friends want to know what is the minimum number of operations required for this The friends were unable to solve this problem so can you help them dagger A sequence c is a subsequence of a sequence d if c can be obtained from d by the deletion of several possibly zero or all elements ,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
