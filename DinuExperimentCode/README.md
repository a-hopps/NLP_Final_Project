For this experiment we simply ran the pre trained and fine tuned model from Dinu et al. We used as base their code, therefore there is the need for all of this extra files in the classifier folder. However, for our experiments we simply ran the ColabEnvironment.ipynb jupyter notebook on Colab, which pulls in the model and runs the necessary experiments and calculates the probabilities for each class, which we then use this results to compare the values in the outside DinuAnalysis folder.
